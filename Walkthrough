# Bug Fix Walkthrough: The AI Museum

Successfully debugged and fixed the issues reported on the website. The core issues were a combination of React lifecycles and `three.js` (drei) 3D dimension scaling.

## Changes Made

1. **Hydration Mismatch:** Added `suppressHydrationWarning` to the `<html>` and `<body>` tags in `app/layout.tsx`. Next-Themes frequently causes these hydration logs due to syncing system themes on the first render before the server-rendered HTML can catch up.
2. **Infinite Boot Sequence:** Repaired the `setInterval` logic inside of `BootSequence.tsx`. We included React dependency cleanup flags (`isMounted`, `clearTimeout`, `clearInterval`) to stop the text generation from duplicating indefinitely on strict-mode double-mounts.
3. **Pointer Events Blocking UI:** Conditionally set `pointer-events-auto` on the 3D wrapper overlay before booting, allowing the user to click the `INITIALIZE NEURAL LINK` button, while allowing pointer events to pass through the empty CRT screen after the boot sequence completes.
4. **Dimension Collapsing in `three/drei` (<Html>):** Explicitly moved the width and height assignments for `@react-three/drei`'s `<Html>` wrapper from the React styling prop down into the actual child DOM tree. 

## Validation Results

**Build Check:**
The application compiles fully optimized successfully.
```bash
> next build
▲ Next.js 16.1.6 (Turbopack)
✓ Compiled successfully in 5.0s
✓ Generating static pages using 21 workers (55/55) in 1018.0ms
```

**Browser Validation:**
The browser subagent confirmed the missing double hydration and the interactive "INITIALIZE NEURAL LINK".
