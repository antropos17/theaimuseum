# The AI Museum
> The world's first interactive online museum of artificial intelligence history. 40 exhibits spanning 1950-2026. Free, open-source, no login required.

## About
The AI Museum documents 76 years of AI breakthroughs, failures, and cultural moments — from Alan Turing's 1950 question "Can machines think?" to GPT-5.2 Pro in 2025. Built for students, researchers, developers, journalists, and anyone curious about how machines learned to think.
