# THE AI MUSEUM — Project Rules for Cursor Agent

## PROJECT IDENTITY
- Name: The AI Museum — interactive encyclopedia of AI history
- Stack: Next.js 14 (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Lucide React
- Design: "Neo-8-Bit" — CRT terminal aesthetic + glassmorphism
- Theme: Dark default (#0a0a0f bg), accent #00ff88, JetBrains Mono font
- Icons: Lucide React ONLY. Never use emoji in UI.
- Deploy: Vercel

## BEHAVIOR RULES

### When I share a screenshot or image:
1. DO NOT write code immediately.
2. First, perform a UX audit:
   - Visual hierarchy: Is the most important element the most prominent?
   - Contrast: Are text and interactive elements readable? (WCAG AA minimum)
   - Click targets: Are buttons/links at least 44x44px? (Fitts's Law)
   - Cognitive load: Can the user understand the purpose within 3 seconds? (Miller's Law — max 7±2 chunks)
   - Consistency: Does it match our Neo-8-Bit terminal aesthetic?
   - Mobile: Will this work on 375px width?
3. Output a numbered list of 3-5 specific problems.
4. WAIT for my approval before writing any code.

### When writing code:
- Keep component files under 300 lines. If growing larger, propose splitting.
- Use TypeScript strict mode patterns.
- Add brief comments on non-obvious logic.
- Preserve ALL existing animations, CRT overlays, and styling.
- Do not modify files not mentioned in the task.
- Follow the design system:
  - Borders: border-border default, border-dashed interactive, border-primary/30 hover
  - Glass: bg-card/30 backdrop-blur-sm border-border/50
  - Terminal chrome: red/yellow/green dots + mono label + .exe suffix
  - Prompt prefix: ">" before interactive elements
  - Bracket labels: [LABEL] for section markers
  - Font sizes: text-[10px] labels, text-[11px] mono UI, text-xs body

### After successful changes:
- Remind me to test on localhost.
- Remind me to commit: `git add -A && git commit -m "описание"`
- Suggest the commit message in English, short and specific.
